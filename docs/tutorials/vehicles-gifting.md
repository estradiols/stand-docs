## Important information
### Get a full garage
Filling up an entire garage can be done in a couple ways and on every type of garage.

- Buy an entire garage full of free cars from any of the ingame stores.
- Steal cheap civilian vehicles and store them in set garage.
- Spawn cheap civilian vechiles and store them in set garage.

To make this easy and fast, make sure to use a small or the smallest garages available.  
**Note: This tutorial works best when using the old style garages**

### Sell values
Most vehicles obtained this way won't be sellable or will only be sell for GTA$ 50,000.  
But there are some Arena War vehicles that will sell up to GTA$ 1,000,000 if spawned fully tuned.  
Recommeded vehicle for this: **Shock Deathbike** (`deathbike2`).  

**However to avoid bans/problems, make sure to stay within safe sell limits:**

- Not more than 2 sales per 2 real-world hours.
- Not more than 7 sales per 30 real-world hours.
