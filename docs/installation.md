## Launch / Inject
### **Using Stand with the Launchpad.**

Before you read this I want to make sure you understand. **Stand and its Launchpad do not have to be installed**.  
But is has dependencies it requires to run that needs to be installed properly.

- [.NET Framework 4.72 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net472-web-installer)
- [Visual C++ Redistributables](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

Once you made sure the requirements are installed, all that is left is for you to run the launchpad!  
**Really, it is this simple!** ðŸ™Œ

### **Alternative ways of using Stand.**

#### Automatic injection via DLL.

If you want to use Stand without having to go through the launchpad,  
there is a way you can inject the dll directly into GTA.

You simply have to download the latest DLL file from [here](https://stand.gg/dl/D3DCOMPILER_43.dll).  
Then you paste this directly into the root folder of GTA.

#### Using another DLL injector.

You can also use other DLL injectors such as [Xenos](https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases/latest) or [Extreme Injector](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/general-programming-and-reversing/213038-extreme-injector-v3-7-a.html) to inject Stand.  
But keep in mind that this will not have the auto update feature the launchpad offers.  
You can download the DLL from the Stand website but keep in mind to check if it's the latest version.

- [Stand 0.71.4.dll](https://stand.gg/Stand%200.71.4.dll)

## Activate Stand
If you bought one of the premium versions of Stand and you already created an account on [stand.gg](https://stand.gg/).  
You will need to activate the menu in order to use it online.

### Step by step

1. Login on the [account](https://stand.gg/account/) page with your `Account ID`.
2. Copy the `Activation Key` that starts with `Stand-Activate-` (click on the key).
3. Open GTA and load into Multiplayer or Online and Inject Stand.
4. In the Stand Menu nativate to `Activate` followed by `Paste Activation Key`.

If you have done this correctly, all should be working and you're ready to go! âœŒ
