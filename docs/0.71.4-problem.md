So you ended up here because you like many others seem to have an issue with Stand.  
Your menu suddenly decided to not show up anymore and/or 'de-auths' you?

At this current moment we have no solid information on why this is happening and how to fix it.  
And we can only hope that the developer will find the issue, but meanwhile you can try the work arounds.

This page will be updated when we have more news, work arounds or anything else related to this problem.  
If you found another work around that seem to work for you, make sure to message me on the Stand Discord.  
You can find me there under this name `> GayCookie.dev ðŸŒˆ#1337`.

## Exlude other issues
To make sure we excluded all other problems what you first wanna do is clear the `Bin` and `Cache` folder.

- Close Stand Launchpad 
- Navigate to `%AppData%\Stand`
- Remove the `Bin` and `Cache` folder.
- Start Stand Launchpad.

## Work Around #1
What for a lot of people seem to work is making sure you have the `Stand-Activate-` key on your clipboard at all time.  
While this not works for everyone, there is nothing to lose to give it a shot.

## Work Around #2
- Close GTA completely followed by closing Stand Launchpad.
- Open Stand Launchpad and check if its on the latest update (0.71.6).
- Open GTA and load into Singleplayer
- Inject Stand and if it tells you to activate it, activate it.
- Load Multiplayer via Stand by navigating to `Online > Session > Find new Online Session`.
