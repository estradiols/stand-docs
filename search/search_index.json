This is a dumbed down version of what should work in most theme cases. I try to cover every detail. Download a theme. Maybe you already done this step and that is how you ended up here, or maybe you are more like me and first read this before even downloading something. If you still have to find a theme, you might wanna check out the #theme section in the Stand discord. You can also check out the resources list with resources for Stand. Install additional software. Some themes are packaged using WinRar and use the extension .rar , If this is the case, you wanna make sure to download and install WinRar or 7Zip . An optional step for the more advanced users can also be a good code/text editor. Make a backup. Mistakes and f*ckups are in small corners, even I make them occasionally. When installing a theme in Stand its really adviced to make a backup of certain things. So I really hope you're not skipping this part of the entire document. In case of installing a theme it's good to make a backup of the following items. These items can be found in the Stand folder located at %AppData%/Stand . Theme - folder This folder contains icons used by themes, themes can have custom icons so always backup this folder. This folder can be found in the root of the Stand folder. Custom Header - folder This folder contains custom headers, themes can have custom headers so always backup this folder. This folder can be found inside the Headers folder inside the root of the Stand folder. Your current active Profile - Profile(s) With the new system Stand has included Profiles that have replaced State.txt . This makes making a backup of your current settings/options very easy. You can easily make a backup by going to Stand > Profiles and select/create a backup profile. Once you have done this you can save your current settings in this profile and you are good to go. You do not have to save this on another location, unless you really do not trust yourself \ud83d\ude02 Installation Copy the files. Loading the Profile. Copy the files.

Copy the .txt file (Profile) to the Stand Profiles folder. If the theme has .lua scripts, you can copy those into Lua Scripts folder. Then you copy the Theme folder into the Stand root folder and overwrite what it wants to overwrite. If it has a header, you can copy this into the Headers/Custom Header folder. The Custom Header folder should be emptied before you going to use a new header If you have done all the above, you're almost done! All you need to do now is loading the profile .
